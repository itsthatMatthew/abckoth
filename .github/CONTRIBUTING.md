# Project contribution guidelines

We welcome anyone wanting to improve our project: if you want to expand the codebase, fix some bugs, or just add new, experimental features, feel free to contribute in any way!

Some useful places to get your bearings of:
- Checking our [README](../README.md) should give you a clear overview of the project.
- You can view existing [Issues](https://github.com/itsthatMatthew/abckoth/issues) or create new ones to tackle problems within the codebase.
- You can look up the [LLVM Coding Standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html) to get an idea of the code style we expect.
- Forking and creating [pull requests](https://github.com/itsthatMatthew/abckoth/pulls) are the most immediate way you can help us.
- If you have any questions about the GitHub ecosystem, give their [support page](https://support.github.com/) a look.

## Issues

If you find any problems within the project, search the [Issues](https://github.com/itsthatMatthew/Project-Thunderstrike/issues) page, a relevant one might just already exist. If it does not, feel free to open a new one, providing the necessary information.

For a more hands on experience, you can look for issues you want to solve. If you've made the necessary changes, you can create a pull request so that we can review and merge it.

## Creating pull requests

Pull requests let you improve the codebase in the most hands-on way possible.

- After forking the repository, create a new working branch.
- You should add your fixes and improvements in smaller chunks: each commit should tackle a single and well-defined problem.
- Your pull requests should have a straight to the point title and thorough description. If you are solving an issue, link it to the pull request.

If everything is fine, your pull request should be merged.

The provided templates should give you a clear direction of the expected issue and pull request formatting.
